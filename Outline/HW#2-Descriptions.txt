                     Assignment 2 (Due: Sunday 17/11/2019)
                     ====================================

This assignment is about developing a student course registration system 
for students to select and register courses in the Academic Registrar 
environment. In particular, the following features and functions
are expected:

1) Data should be stored in an Oracle database. At least 3 tables
should be involved for the assignment (e.g. Courses, Students,
Enrollment). The dataset given in the "dataset.sql" file of the
attached zipfile should be used for the exercises..

2) The system should be implemented as a Java application with a GUI
(Graphical User Interface). It should get access to the underlying
database through Oracle-JDBC.

3) The following kinds of queries are to be supported:
	(a) A user should be able to login to the system as a student or an
	    administrator.
	(b) A student should be able to list all the courses in the system.
	(c) A student should be able to list all the courses that he/she has
	    registered.
	(d) A student should be able to register courses in the system.
	(e) A student should be able to modify his/her personal information.
	(f) An administrator should be able to list all the courses and
	    students in the system.
	(g) Given a department name, an administrator should be able to list
	    all the students in the department.
	(h) An administrator should be able to add a new course or student
	    to the system.
	(i) An administrator should be able to modify the information of a
	    course or a student in the system.
	(j) An administrator should be able to delete a course or a student
	    from the system.
	(k) An administrator should be able to modify the grade of a student
	    for one of his/her registered courses.

	(l) An administrator should be able to list the top 5 students that
	    have most courses registered.*
	(m) An administrator should be able to list the top 5 students with
	    the highest average grade values.*

Note1: Queries (l) and (m) are extra ones for bonus points (ie, these are 
       optional). In handling these two queries, you may choose to break ties 
       arbitrarily, if any, when listing the top-N results.

Note2: Extra bonus points may be given if you are able to define and use  
       indexes for efficient join queries in the program.

Note3: Extra bonus points may be given if the GUI of your program is good and
       user friendly (easy and clear to use).

_________
Remark 1: The assignment can be done with a team of two students,
although a single-student team is also possible. Please try to finalize 
your team composition as soon as possible!

Remark 2: For submission, each team is asked to hand in a brief
documentation of your system, including a user-manual, a short demo,
and the source code. A brief description of each team member's work
is also expected.
